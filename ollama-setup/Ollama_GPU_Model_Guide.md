## ‚úÖ Models You Can Comfortably Run

| Model              | Quantization | VRAM Use (Approx.) | Status       | Notes |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| **LLaMA 3 7B**     | Q4_K, Q6_K   | 6‚Äì8 GB              | ‚úÖ Yes       | Excellent balance of speed and accuracy |
| **Mistral 7B**     | Q4_K         | 6‚Äì8 GB              | ‚úÖ Yes       | Efficient, compact, and smart |
| **Gemma 7B**       | Q4_K         | ~6 GB               | ‚úÖ Yes       | Lightweight and optimized |
| **Mixtral (MoE)**  | Q4_K         | ~9‚Äì10 GB (2 experts)| ‚úÖ Yes       | Very powerful with MoE efficiency |
| **LLaMA 3 13B**    | Q4_K         | 10‚Äì12 GB            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes       | Works, but close to VRAM limit |
| **LLaMA 30B**      | Any          | 20‚Äì24+ GB           | ‚ùå No        | Exceeds GPU and RAM limits |

## üöß Limitations

- **12GB VRAM = upper limit**: Anything beyond ~11.5GB may crash or fall back to CPU.
- **13B models** can run with `Q4_K` quantization, but leave little room for multitasking.
- **30B+ models** are **not supported** due to VRAM and RAM constraints.

---

## üß∞ Tips

- ‚úÖ **Stick to 7B and MoE models** (like Mistral and Mixtral) for fast, accurate performance.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use **`nvidia-smi`** to monitor GPU usage during inference.
- ‚ùå Avoid running other GPU-heavy apps (e.g., games, rendering) alongside Ollama.

## üî• Recommended Commands

```bash
# Mistral 7B
ollama run mistral

# LLaMA 3 13B (Q4_K)
ollama run llama3:13b-q4_K

# Mixtral (sparse MoE model)
ollama run mixtral:instruct
```

---

## üß† Want to Go Bigger?

- Run 30B+ models **CPU-only** (very slow)
- Wait for **GPU offloading features**
- Upgrade to **24GB+ VRAM GPU** (e.g., RTX 4090 or A6000)

Happy modeling! üöÄ
